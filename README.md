# JKL Grammar

`Version 1.0.0`

* [Plugin Page](https://github.com/jekkilekki/plugin-jkl-grammar)
* [Author Page](https://aaron.kr/)

A simple plugin that adds a "Grammar" Custom Post Type to better organize grammar points for language learning blogs and sites.

## Description

Requires WordPress 3.5 and PHP 5.5 or later.

This plugin was built for my own Korean language learning site (keytokorean.com) to
enable me to better organize the grammar points I'm studying. It includes the following taxonomies:

1. Level (Beginner, etc)
2. Book (Seoul University, Korean Grammar in Use, etc)
3. Part of Speech (Verb, Noun, etc)
4. Expression (frustation, excitement, etc)
5. Usage (formal, written, spoken, etc)

### Planned Upcoming Features 

I'm looking into adding "subtitle" support that would let me put the Title in Korean and the subtitle in English. But we'll use this for a while and see how I'm actually putting it to use and what kinds of things I feel are still needed before laying out a roadmap for future development.

### Translations

* English (EN) - default
* Korean (KO) - upcoming

If you want to help translate the plugin into your language, please have a look 
at the `.pot` file which contains all definitions and may be used with a [gettext] 
editor.

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, 
you can send your [gettext .po or .mo file] to me so that I can bundle it in the
plugin.

### Contact Me

plugin, please let me know at the [WordPress.org support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jkl-grammar)
